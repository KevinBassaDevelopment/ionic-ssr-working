# ionic-ssr-working
Working example for an ionic github issue

An example to visualize the ionic SSR process.
To see it in detail:
 
1) npm run build:ssr   (to have prod version with minimum bundle size)
2) npm run serve:ssr
3) open browser, set network speed to slow-3g
4) load localhost:4000
     -> blank page when swapping between server side rendered page and client side rendered page
